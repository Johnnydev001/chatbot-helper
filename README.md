# 3D Gemini Chatbot

## Introduction
This repository was made for learning purposes and to demonstrate how to create an interactive 3D experience on the web.
The idea was to use a model of a robot which could be enhanced with a simple user interface. The purpose of the interface is to let the user send and receive messages from Gemini (Google's chatbot), just like in its own UI.
If the user writes bad words, the robot turns red, warning the user of a bad prompt.
